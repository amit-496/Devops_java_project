# Azure Monitoring Options for CPU, Memory, and Disk Space 

## Overview

This document outlines the options of monitoring CPU, memory, and disk space in Azure using Azure's native monitoring tools.

## Monitoring Options

Azure offers various services for monitoring resources, applications, and infrastructure:

1. **Azure Monitor**: Centralized solution for monitoring both Azure and on-premises resources. 
    - Metrics include CPU, memory, and disk usage.
    - Alerts for resource thresholds.
    - Custom dashboards for real-time visualization.

2. **Azure Monitor for VMs**: Provides in-depth monitoring for virtual machines (VMs), covering performance metrics such as:
    - CPU, memory, and disk I/O.
    - Alerts and diagnostics for VM-level issues.

3. **Azure Log Analytics**: Enables collection and querying of logs and performance data from Azure resources. Integrates with Azure Monitor to create log-based alerts and performance analysis.

4. **Azure Monitor Alerts**: Set rules based on performance thresholds for CPU, memory, and disk space.
    - Example: Trigger an alert if CPU usage exceeds 80% or if disk space falls below 20%.

## Detailed Cost Breakdown

Azure Monitor and Log Analytics costs depend on data ingestion, retention, and alert configurations. Here’s a breakdown:

### **1. Metrics Cost**

- **Basic Platform Metrics**: Free for most Azure services, including:
    - CPU, memory, and disk utilization metrics for VMs and containers.
    - Network and storage-related metrics.
    - Other service-related metrics, such as HTTP response times, throughput, etc.

- **Custom Metrics**: For user-defined metrics (beyond Azure’s default offerings), there is a cost:
    - $0.15 per time series per metric per month.

    *Example*: If you are defining custom metrics like a specific threshold for disk I/O or memory usage, custom metrics charges will apply.

- **Logs for Metrics**: $2.76 per GB of data ingested for storing custom logs or metric logs into Azure Monitor.

### **2. Alerts Cost**

- **Basic Alerts (Free)**: Free for simple, resource-level alerts. This includes:
    - Metric-based alerts (CPU, Memory, Disk).
    - Activity log-based alerts (resource status changes, errors, etc.).

    *Example*: Setting a basic alert on CPU usage exceeding 80% or disk space falling below 20% is free.

- **Advanced Alerts**:
    - **Multi-resource Alerts**: Alerts that trigger based on conditions across multiple resources or complex queries incur a charge of $0.10 per alert rule per month.
    - **Alert Notifications**:
        - **Email Notifications**: Free.
        - **SMS, Voice, or Push Notifications**: $0.50 per notification.

### **3. Log Analytics Pricing**

- **Data Ingestion**: $2.76 per GB of data ingested.
- **Data Retention**:
  - Free for up to 31 days.
  - ~$0.12 per GB for extended retention beyond 31 days.

### **4. Azure Monitor for VMs**

- **VM Monitoring**:
  - Cost is aligned with Log Analytics ingestion fees (~$2.76 per GB).

## Key Features & Benefits

### **1. Real-Time Monitoring**

Azure Monitor provides instant insights into the performance of your infrastructure. The main benefits include:
- **CPU Utilization**: Track how much processing power your virtual machines or containers are using. 
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption, helping to identify memory leaks or excessive usage.
- **Disk I/O and Disk Space**: Get real-time insights into disk usage and input/output operations, crucial for ensuring there is sufficient storage space and no bottlenecks.

These metrics are gathered through **Azure Monitor** and **Azure Metrics Explorer**, which natively collect data from Azure resources.

### **2. Custom Alerts**

Azure Monitor allows the creation of custom alerts based on specific thresholds or events:
- Set alerts for high CPU usage, low disk space, or excessive memory usage.
- Customize alert severity levels (e.g., warning, critical) and trigger different notifications for each.
- Alerts can be configured to notify via **Email** (free), or **SMS, Voice, and Push Notifications** (paid).

You can also set up **log-based alerts** through **Azure Log Analytics** for more complex scenarios involving multiple conditions or resources.

### **3. Dashboards**

Custom dashboards allow you to visualize data from multiple resources in a single, easy-to-read format:
- **Azure Monitor Dashboards**: You can build dashboards that track CPU, memory, and disk metrics across multiple virtual machines or containers.
- **Azure Metrics Explorer**: This tool provides the ability to query and visualize metrics data in real time, across different timeframes.

Dashboards can be shared with team members and can include charts, grids, and other visualizations that update in real-time.

### **4. Third-Party Tool Integration**

Azure provides seamless integration with many popular third-party incident management and DevOps tools. These integrations help streamline incident management, alerting, and reporting.

- **PagerDuty**: Automate incident escalation and on-call notifications when alerts are triggered in Azure Monitor.
- **ServiceNow**: Automatically generate incidents in ServiceNow based on alerts in Azure Monitor.
- **Slack and Microsoft Teams**: Get real-time alerts directly in your messaging tools for faster team collaboration.
- **Jira**: Automatically create tickets in Jira based on Azure Monitor alerts, helping to track incidents and issues within a project management workflow.
- **Splunk**: Forward Azure Monitor data to Splunk for centralized log aggregation and advanced analysis.
- **DataDog**: Integrate with DataDog to pull Azure Monitor metrics into a unified dashboard for multi-cloud and on-premises monitoring.

With these integrations, Azure becomes part of a broader ecosystem for incident response and resolution, ensuring fast and efficient troubleshooting when issues arise.

### **5. Automation**

Azure Monitor integrates with **Azure Automation** and other orchestration tools to automatically remediate issues when alerts are triggered:
- **Auto-Scaling**: Automatically add more virtual machines when CPU usage exceeds a certain threshold, ensuring system performance remains optimal.
- **Auto-Healing**: Restart or replace faulty virtual machines if metrics like CPU, memory, or disk health indicate failures.
- **Runbooks**: Use Azure Automation runbooks to trigger scripts that solve common issues, such as clearing logs or restarting services when certain thresholds are crossed.

This automation can reduce manual intervention and help prevent downtime.

### **6. Security and Compliance**

Azure Monitor can integrate with **Azure Security Center** and **Azure Policy** for enhanced security and compliance monitoring:
- **Azure Security Center**: Detect security vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or potential threats using real-time monitoring and alerts.
- **Azure Policy**: Ensure compliance with industry regulations by monitoring resource configurations and generating alerts when violations are detected.

Both tools help ensure that your system not only performs well but also adheres to security and compliance best practices.


### **7. Cost Optimization**

Azure Monitor's integration with **Azure Cost Management** allows you to track the cost of your monitoring setup, helping you optimize and reduce expenses. You can:
- Analyze the cost of log data ingestion and retention.
- View the cost associated with specific alerts or metrics.
- Optimize your monitoring strategy by limiting data retention periods or disabling unnecessary alerts.

**Azure Advisor** also provides cost-saving recommendations based on your usage patterns and configurations.

### **8. Machine Learning Insights**

Azure Monitor integrates with **Azure Machine Learning** to provide predictive insights. Using machine learning models, you can:
- Predict future CPU, memory, or disk space consumption based on historical data.
- Forecast potential issues, such as running out of disk space or memory, and take preemptive actions.
- Detect anomalies or trends that deviate from normal patterns.

These capabilities provide a more proactive approach to monitoring, helping prevent issues before they impact the system.
